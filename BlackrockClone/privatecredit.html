    <h2>Introduction: The rapid growth of private markets</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Private markets are rapidly expanding, with a pivotal spotlight on private credit.</strong> As investors seek new ways to diversify and enhance returns, private markets are becoming a core component of long-term portfolios. Institutional investors — and increasingly, private wealth clients — are allocating more to private assets to access broader sources of income and return potential.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Private markets have expanded significantly over the past decade as investors seek new sources of diversification and return amid shifting capital market dynamics. Within this universe, private credit has emerged as one of the most dynamic areas — providing financing to companies outside of the traditional banking system while offering investors potential for higher yields and lower volatility compared with public credit markets.</p>
    <p>This expansion reflects a structural transformation in global finance: as banks reduce certain lending activities following regulatory changes, private lenders have stepped in to meet the growing demand for capital. As a result, private credit has become an essential component of modern portfolios for both institutional and individual investors.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The scale of the private credit opportunity</h2>
    <p>Private credit has grown into a multi-trillion-dollar market, driven by strong investor demand and the ongoing evolution of non-bank lending. In the U.S. alone, the private credit market now exceeds $1.7 trillion, and growth is accelerating globally as companies seek flexible, relationship-based sources of financing to fuel innovation and expansion.</p>
    <p>This asset class offers compelling opportunities for attractive income generation and portfolio diversification, particularly in an environment where public fixed income yields remain constrained. For investors able to tolerate less liquidity, private credit can provide differentiated risk-return characteristics that complement traditional bond holdings.</p>

  <!-- Adding private credit to investment portfolios -->
  <section>
    <h2>Adding private credit to investment portfolios</h2>
    <p>Historically, access to private credit was limited to large institutional investors due to high investment minimums, long lockups, and complex structures. Today, innovation in product design, digital infrastructure, and fund vehicles is opening the door to a much wider audience of investors seeking exposure to this growing market.</p>
    <p>Incorporating private credit into a diversified portfolio can enhance income potential and reduce overall volatility. Even modest allocations can contribute meaningfully to risk-adjusted returns, particularly when implemented as part of a long-term investment strategy aligned with liquidity needs and portfolio objectives.</p>
